Hello! My name is Laura and I am a junior at Pitzer studying Linguistics.
I like to knit and crochet

Three foods i greatly enjoy:

<ul>
<li> french toast </li>
<li> bananas </li>
<li> powdered sugar </li>
</ul>

So here is a photo of me eating my three favorite foods all together as a delicious banana french toast meal
